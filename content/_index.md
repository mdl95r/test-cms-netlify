    Initially developed and released by Gearbox Software in 2001,
    second Half-Life add-on, Half-Life: Blue Shift is a return to the Black Mesa
    Research Facility and another look at the Incident's consequences from the
    eyes of Gordon Freeman's best friend - Barney Calhoun.


    In 2012, Crowbar Collective has delighted Half-Life fans with release of the magnificent Half-Life remake, but there are still no released remakes for add-ons. This is when we are coming in - HECU Collective are developing the Black Mesa: Blue Shift - a free remake with use of Black Mesa resources and style. We will try to stay as close to the original Blue Shift and Black Mesa as possible. Our mod will be releasing partially, chapter by chapter, so those who are not patient for the full release will finally have something to play!

    The team was founded on December 10, 2016. April 2018, the AS team joined
    the main development team, thereby forming the **HECU Collective**.


    At the same time, we do not limit ourselves to the framework and can post both a trailer for a new game/mod on the Source engine, and interesting news from the world of half-life and other games from Valve.
